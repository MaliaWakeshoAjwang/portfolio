Initially, I wrote a script to handle these calculations and printed the results with console.log(). Later, I made the program interactive by building a React component that allows users to input a Kelvin temperature and dynamically see the corresponding Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Newton values. Using React state, I managed the input and results, designing a clean and user-friendly UI with HTML and CSS. I deployed the project to GitHub Pages, configuring routing to ensure smooth navigation and accessibility.
